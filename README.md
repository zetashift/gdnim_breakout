# Breakout in Nim & Godot

A basic breakout clone, adopting [HeartBeast tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntYjl_obUDo&list=PL9FzW-m48fn1iR6WL4mjXtGi8P4TaPIAp) and [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) and [GDNim](https://github.com/geekrelief/gdnim).

## Getting Started

Install Nim and GDNim, both have detailed installation instructions. It'll take a lil while, but it's a great developing experience after that. Then open `/app/project.godot` in Godot.

Assets are all from [this beautiful pack](https://artemouse.itch.io/breakout-pixel-assets)
## Notes

I made this repo mainly for learning purposes.
